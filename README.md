# Configs & Documentation
- Learning and setting up `neovim`, `Alacritty` & `tmux` for development.
- Will keep a track of my processes.

## Terminal
- Need to use Alacritty. Just like it and it is easier to configure.
- Get Nerd fonts & `SF Mono`. Copy the `*.otf` and/or `*.ttf` files to 
`/usr/share/fonts`.
- Make the necessary changes to your `alacritty.yml`.

## Termux
- First install TMUX `sudo apt-get install tmux`.
- Acquaint yourself with a few of the commands. Hit `Ctrl+b` then `?` to pull
up the help menu.
- From now on, `Ctrl+*xxx*` will be written as `<C-xxx>`. It is the official
lingo and type ligature, you might as well get used to it. To that effect,
the instruction for help is `<C-b>` then `?`.
- *Note, we say then because you first hit `Ctrl` and `b` simultaneoulsy,
release both then hit `?` separately. Kindly take note*.
- Here are few default key-bindings, yours truly thinks every beginner should
familiarise themselves with:
		> `x` - as.
- Next, customise it to your liking, can use the guide below as a starting 
point:
